If you do not run with "--setup" initially, GitHubIt will assume global Git settings.

"--setup" will NOT setup a Git repo. For that clone or init a repo.

Warning :	"--setup" WILL OVERWRITE ".gitignore" at the root directory of the project, if any
			"--setup" WILL add ".gitignore" too to ".gitignore"
			
Note :	"--commit" without any files specified, would commit all changed files
		in "--commit", if a specified file is not tracked IT WILL BE SET AS TRACKED before the commit
